This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to the loose comparison operator (`==`) when used with the `strpos()` function.  The `strpos()` function, when a substring is not found, returns `false`. However, in loose comparison, `false` is equivalent to 0, which can lead to unexpected results and logic errors in your code. The provided code snippets highlight the problem and its solution.
