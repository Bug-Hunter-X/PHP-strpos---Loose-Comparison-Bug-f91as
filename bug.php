This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparisons. The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, and `0` if it's found at the beginning of the haystack.  In a loose comparison (`==`), `false` is equivalent to `0`, leading to unexpected behavior. If the string 'example' is not found within the haystack, `strpos()` returns `false`, which evaluates to `0` when compared loosely with `0`, thus incorrectly entering the `if` block.
